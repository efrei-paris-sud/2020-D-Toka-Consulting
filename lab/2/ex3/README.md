# Exercise 3

We had to connect an Arduino Uno to a LCD, a BMP280 sensor and a relay.
Unfortunalety, because of some issues we had to use the sofware Fritzing to a make a schema of it.

## Fritzing

Fritzing is an open-source initiative[3] to develop amateur or hobby CAD software for the design 
of electronics hardware, to support designers and artists ready to move from experimenting with a prototype to building a more permanent circuit.

## Schematic

- The red cable - **VCC**
- The blue cable - **GROUND**
- The yellow cable - **SDA**
- The green cable - **SCL**


## Issues

We didn't have the necessary components and materials to make this exercice properly.
